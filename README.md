# Zenith Go
Zenith Go is the onboard disaster reporting device designed to detect fallen trees, downed power lines, flooded roadways, infrastructure damage, and other property hazards. When seamlessly integrated with the Zenith mobile app, Zenith Go automatically submits damage reports to local emergency management authorities and sends rescue requests to first responders in the event of user distress. 

With Zenith Go, you can confidently navigate disaster situations while ensuring swift and effective response measures.

This initiative is part of the UXDG-490 course curriculum offered by the Savannah College of Art and Design. The project's objective is to conceptualize solutions for humanitarian needs and realize them through the process of prototyping.
